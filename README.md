# cleidy-developer-portfolio# 

## Description

I sought to display the projects that I am most proud of in a way that was easy and convienient to prospective employers. This not only makes showing off my development knowledge simple, it also gives me a chance to demonstrate my web development skills via a custom website. Building from scratch allowed me the opportunity to show off my own unique persona, something that is not so easily done via ready-made website templates or blogs.

Building the site was a challenging exercise in some advance CSS skills. The result is a page that reads smoothly, shows off my own style, and adapts to various screen sizes for optimal viewing.

## Usage

The links provided in the header allow you to jump to any section of my portfolio with one quick click. The picture tiles in the "Work" section are links to different projects I (will eventually have) worked on. 

Three ways to reach out to me (email, phone, and GitHub) are provided in the footer area.
