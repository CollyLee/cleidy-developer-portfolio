            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if
                you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty
                towards
                Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he had imposed on you; but
                his
                success is not perhaps to be wondered at. Ignorant as you previously were of everything
                concerning
                either, detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your
                inclination.<br><br>

                I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation
                less
                than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no
                doubt of your secrecy.
